## Introduction

Farm AI is a comprehensive software solution designed to help farmers analyze, predict, and manage their crops with ease using their Android devices. This readme provides an overview of the Android app and the backend infrastructure, built using Node.js, DevOps practices, and Kubernetes for deployment and management.

## Features

- **Mobile App**: User-friendly Android application for farmers to access data, control irrigation, and receive notifications.
- **Cloud Backend**: Scalable and highly available backend services to manage data and user interactions.

## Mobile App (Android)

The Farm AI mobile app provides a seamless user experience for farmers, offering the following features:

- **Dashboard**: View real-time data and analytics about crops, weather, and soil conditions.
- **Irrigation Control**: Manage and schedule irrigation based on real-time data.
- **Notifications**: Receive alerts about crop health, weather changes, and other important events.

## Backend (Node.js)

The backend for Farm AI is built using Node.js and offers robust and scalable services to support the mobile app. Key features include:

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for farmers.
- **Data Management**: Efficient storage and retrieval of data related to crops, weather, and soil conditions.
- **API Services**: RESTful APIs to facilitate communication between the mobile app and the backend.

## DevOps and Kubernetes

To ensure reliability, scalability, and continuous delivery, Farm AI utilizes DevOps practices and Kubernetes for container orchestration:

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automated pipelines for building, testing, and deploying updates to the backend services.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration for managing the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers across clusters of hosts.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Integrated monitoring and logging to track the performance and health of the backend services.

### Architecture

1. **API Gateway**: Manages incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate services.
2. **Microservices**: Modular services for different functionalities such as user authentication and data management.
3. **Database**: Scalable databases for storing user data and crop data.
4. **Kubernetes Cluster**: Deployment and management of containerized services across multiple nodes.
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated processes for continuous integration and deployment.
